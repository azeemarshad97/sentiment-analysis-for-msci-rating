Elon Musk on road to $50bn payout as Tesla's value passes $100bn ,"The Tesla founder, Elon Musk, has taken the first step to becoming $50bn (£38bn) richer after the value of the electric car company surged past $100bn.

BP shares plunge amid 'low-carbon plan' and slipping oil market ,"BP’s share price has tumbled to a 25-year-low as investor jitters over the company’s ambitious transformation plans collide with fears for the future of the global oil market.

Facebook UK pays just £5.1m in corporation tax despite jump in profit ,"Facebook’s UK operations paid just £5.1m in corporation tax last year, despite a jump in profit and revenues nearly quadrupling on the back of increasing advertising sales.
But its UK corporation tax only rose to £5.1m from £4.2m a year earlier, and once deductible expenses were applied, the company only paid £2.58m.
Facebook said the sharp rise in revenue was “attributable to the commencement of advertising reseller services” by its UK operations in April 2016, which drew in “large UK customers”.
The slight increase in corporation tax came after Facebook was publicly criticised for contributing only £4.3m in tax in 2014 under an arrangement that treated the UK operation’s revenues as a payment from Facebook Ireland for services.
Routing sales through Ireland meant Facebook was liable to corporation tax at a lower rate, but the company announced last year that it would end the practice.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/04/facebook-uk-corporation-tax-profit

Airbus to pay record £3bn in fines for 'endemic' corruption ,"Airbus, Europe’s largest aerospace multinational, is to pay a record £3bn in penalties after admitting it had paid huge bribes on an “endemic” basis to land contracts in 20 countries.

Under the deal, known as a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA), Airbus will pay the penalties and promise to mend its ways.

Google tax deal under fire as it emerges figure included share options scheme,"George Osborne’s claim that the government secured a major corporation tax deal with Google appear to be unravelling after it emerged that a quarter of the £130m recovered by HM Revenue & Customs related to the US company’s share options scheme.

John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said there was an important distinction between a settlement for unpaid corporation tax based on Google’s profits and the need to pay tax on share options for staff.

Google tax deal under fire as it emerges figure included share options scheme ,"George Osborne’s claim that the government secured a major corporation tax deal with Google appear to be unravelling after it emerged that a quarter of the £130m recovered by HM Revenue & Customs related to the US company’s share options scheme.
MPs and foreign governments have criticised the deal for allowing Google to generate billions of pounds in profits from its UK business and pay little corporation tax.
John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said there was an important distinction between a settlement for unpaid corporation tax based on Google’s profits and the need to pay tax on share options for staff.
He said the low rate of corporation tax paid by Google, which was already “totally unacceptable”, needed to be independently examined.

BP boss says protests against its arts funding 'just feel odd' ,"BP’s chief executive, Bob Dudley, has branded the UK backlash against the oil company’s arts sponsorship the “oddest approach” in the climate debate.

He told a Chatham House event that the recent spate of protests is “very curious” and “just feels odd” when there is “overwhelming feedback” in support of its arts funding.

Netflix accused of funnelling UK profits through Netherlands ,"Netflix has been accused of funnelling as much as £330m in profits made from operations outside the US into tax havens, while receiving generous relief for making shows such as The Crown in the UK, which helped cut its bill.
The Taxwatch thinktank has estimated that in 2018 Netflix moved between $327m and $430m (£250m-£330m) in profits from international operations outside the US, including the UK, to low-tax jurisdictions such as the Netherlands.
Despite having more than 10 million subscribers paying more than £860m in subscription fees each year in the UK, Netflix UK received a €57,000 (£51,000) rebate from the government in 2018.

The new length specifications mean shoppers should benefit from a fresher, uncut product, meaning less food waste in the home.
