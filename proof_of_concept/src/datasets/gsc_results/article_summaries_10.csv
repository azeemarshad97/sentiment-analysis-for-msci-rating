BP leads energy companies preparing two major UK carbon capture projects ,environmental,"After decades spent extracting fossil fuels from the UK’s North Sea, a consortium of oil companies is preparing to pump Britain’s greenhouse gas emissions back beneath the seabed to help meet the government’s climate ambitions.
BP has set out plans to lead an alliance of energy companies in siphoning off the carbon dioxide from factory flues under new plans in which almost half the UK’s industrial emissions will be stored beneath the North Sea from 2026.
The new alliance will operate the pipes and storage facility needed to transport the emissions from both industrial zones and dispose of almost 50% of the UK’s industrial emissions in saline aquifers beneath the North Sea seabed.
Carbon capture and storage is considered vital to the UK’s legally binding target to create a carbon neutral economy by 2050.
The Northern Endurance Alliance has applied for funding from the government’s £170m industrial decarbonisation challenge which was set up this time last year.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/27/bp-leads-energy-companies-preparing-two-major-uk-carbon-capture-projects
Amazon told: time is up for tax avoidance,governance,"Tax structures used by Amazon to route billions of pounds from sales to British customers through Luxembourg, paying negligible UK tax, are among a series of international loopholes earmarked for closure in a programme of reforms backed by G20 nations.
The ""once-in-a-century"" move to patch up holes in international tax rules was unveiled in Moscow by George Osborne and fellow finance ministers from France and Germany, who have together been the driving force behind calls for reform.
""It is clear multinational companies have developed an unprecedented know-how for minimising their worldwide tax pressure,"" he said.

"SSE powers to 40% rise in retail profits despite losing 500,000 customers ",environmental,"SSE has rekindled the simmering row over high energy bills by revealing it boosted its retail profits by 40% despite falling demand for power and the company losing half a million customers.

Why Schroders' reshuffle looks like a triumph of chumminess ,governance,"Well played, Michael Dobson, that was a terrific 14-year innings as chief executive of fund manager Schroders, one of the few grand old City names to flourish in the modern world.
He is merely moving into the chairman’s office, a switch that – as usual on these occasions – looks like a triumph of chumminess over common sense.
The new chief executive operates under a shadow.
Schroders, managing £313bn of other people’s money, is a firm we expect to read the riot act on governance to quoted companies.
Schroders says there are cases where, having assessed the merits, it has approved of a chief executive becoming chairman – although it couldn’t name any immediately.",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/03/schroders-reshuffle-board-chairman-chief-executive-corporate-governance

Elon Musk on road to $50bn payout as Tesla's value passes $100bn ,governance,"The Tesla founder, Elon Musk, has taken the first step to becoming $50bn (£38bn) richer after the value of the electric car company surged past $100bn.
Under the scheme corporate governance experts have described as “staggering”, Musk must build Tesla into a $650bn company over the next 10 years.
Provided Tesla also hits ambitious revenue and profit targets, and assuming Musk remains its chief executive, such growth would also trigger payments in stock worth about $50bn over the course of the scheme.
At the time the deal was agreed in March 2018, Tesla was valued by the stock market at $54.6bn.
If Musk can keep the stock market value at above $100bn on average over the next six months, he will be entitled to the first of up to 12 stock payouts, worth around $350m each.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/22/elon-musk-on-road-to-50bn-payout-as-teslas-value-passes-100bn
