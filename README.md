# Automatic Sustainability Rating System for Swiss Municipalities


## Introduction
This project explores a sustainability rating system for several Swiss municipalities by analyzing available texts such as the minutes of municipal council meetings. It involves developing a model and collecting enough data to automatically assign ratings across the three pillars (ESG). A process will be established to collect the minutes and calculate ratings for each municipality and a ranking of them. 
The project consists first of classifying each set of minutes according to the ESG pillars, and then assigning a rating for each pillar.
